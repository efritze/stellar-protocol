SEP: 0026
Title: Non-interactive Anchor/Wallet Asset Transfer
Authors: Fritz Ekwoge, Ernest Mbenkum
Status: Draft
Created: 2019-11-16
Updated: 2019-11-18
Version: 0.6.0
```

## Simple Summary

This SEP defines the standard way for wallets to interact with anchors on behalf of users. This improves user experience by allowing wallets and other clients to interact with anchors directly without the user needing to leave the wallet to go to the anchor's site.

It is based on, but backwards incompatible with [SEP-0006](sep-0006.md).

There are cases where the anchor service might wish that all interactions with users happen on a different app or web service hosted by the anchor itself. For such cases, please refer to the interactive workflow found in [SEP-0024](sep-0024.md).

## Abstract

This proposal defines a standard protocol enabling the following features directly within a wallet or other Stellar client:

* Deposit external assets with an anchor
* Withdraw assets from an anchor
* Communicate deposit & withdrawal fee structure for an anchor to the user
* Handle anchor KYC needs, including transmitting KYC information about the user to the anchor via [SEP-12](sep-0012.md)
* Check the status of ongoing deposits or withdrawals involving the user
* View history of deposits and withdrawals involving the user

To support this protocol an anchor acts as a server and implements the specified REST API endpoints, while a wallet implements a client that consumes the API. The goal is interoperability, so a wallet implements a single client according to the protocol, and will be able to interact with any compliant anchor. Similarly, an anchor that implements the API endpoints according to the protocol will work with any compliant wallet.

### Prerequisites (Stellar.toml)

* We introduce the concept of `transfer protocols`. By convention, the transfer protocol described in this document will be called `sep26`. Other transfer protocols include [sep24](sep-0024.md).

* An anchor must define what asset transfer protocols each of its anchored assets accepts. Supported asset transfer protocols will be defined in the `transfer_protocols` field under each [[CURRENCIES]] section in their [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md). **transfer_protocols** is an *array* containing all the asset transfer protocols the asset supports. All parameters for the SEP26 transfer protocol will go under a `[sep26]` section. The `[sep26]` section is placed inside each relevant [[CURRENCIES]] section.

* An anchor must define the location of their `transfer server` in their [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md). This is how a wallet knows where to find the asset's transfer server. By convention, the transfer server for any asset that supports sep26 will be defined in a field called `transfer_server` under the  [sep26] section of the stellar.toml file.

### [sep26.fund_wallet]

Certain anchored assets may support the ability to fund unfunded accounts. In that case, the anchor should specify the following under [sep26.fund_wallet]: 

* `enabled=true`: for assets that support funding of unfunded wallet accounts.
* `amount_native`: the number of lumens the anchored asset will use to fund the wallet
* `fees`: specifies fee structure for funding accounts.  = 2 * XLM/BTC market price.  By convention, you can specify localized translations for your wallet funding fee structure by appending the IETF language tag to fund_wallet_fees. e.g. fund_wallet_fees_fr = "prix de marché XLM/ETH plus 0.0001 ETH".
* `funding_protocols`: an array of funding protocols the anchored asset uses. e.g. [sep25](sep-0025.md). For custom funding protocols that only work on specific wallets, simply use the name of your supported wallets e.g. [walleta, walletb]


## [sep26.deposits] (Stellar.toml)

Deposit metadata for each anchored asset is specified under [sep26.deposits], which is placed under the relevant [sep26] section of the stellar.toml file. Note that the [sep26] is placed under each relevant [[CURRENCIES]] section.

The following fields can be specified:

* `enabled`: Determines if a deposit is enabled or not. Wallets should consider deposits disabled if this field is not specified.

*  `authentication_protocols`: An array of all  authentication methods supported by the anchored asset when performing deposits. An anchored asset that doesn't need any authentication protocol for deposits doesn't need to specify this field. If an anchored asset supports for example  [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) authentication for deposits, the value for authentication_protocols = [sep10].

* `deposit_options`: This field is required. An array of all  deposit options offered by the anchored asset. The deposit options can be named any how you want (stick to alphanumeric characters and underscores. Avoid spaces).  Each deposit option should have a corresponding [sep26.deposits.options.[optionName]] section.  


### [sep26.deposits.options.[optionName]] (Stellar.toml)


The following fields are supported: 

* `name`: e.g. Crypto Deposit.
* `min_amount`
* `max_amount`
* `supported_fields`, an array of extra fields to be displayed and filled by the wallet  before the anchor can release deposit instructions. e.g supported_fields = [dest, email].
* `fee`:
  * By convention, if an anchored asset has   fixed deposit fees, the fixed fee should be defined as "amount currency". So if for example you have fixed deposit fees of an equivalent of 5 USD for each BTC deposit, your deposit fees will be specified as fee = 5 USD.
  * By convention, if an anchored asset uses  percentage fees, the percentage fee should be defined as "percentage%". So if you have a percentage deposit fee of 0.1% for ACH deposits, your deposit fee will be specified as fee = 0.1%
  * For other non-conventional fee structures, either provide a short description of your fee structure, or specify a URL with more info about your fee structure. By convention, you can specify localized translations of your custom deposit fee structure by appending the IETF language tag to the relevant fields. e.g. fee_en_gb = "https://teabankanchor.com/ourfees/?lang=en_gb" , or fee_fr="0.5%. Le maximum c'est 0.1 BTC".
  


### [sep26.deposits.options.[optionName]].fields.[fieldName] (Stellar.toml)

Each deposit option field may have the following attributes.

* `title`: Title of the field. E.g. Your Email
* `optional`: Boolean. Either true or false.
* `type`: can be number, text, email, or choice.
* `choices`: an array of {value: VALUE, name: NAME}.

## [sep26.withdrawals] (Stellar.toml)

See [sep26.deposits]


## [sep26.transaction_history] (Stellar.toml)

Transaction History metadata for each anchored asset is specified under [sep26.transaction_history], which is placed under the relevant [sep26] section of the stellar.toml file. Note that the [sep26] is placed under each relevant [[CURRENCIES]] section.

The following fields can be specified:

* `enabled`: Determines if transaction_histories are enabled or not. Wallets should consider support for transaction_histories disabled if this field is not specified.

*  `authentication_protocols`: An array of all  authentication methods supported by the anchored asset when wallets or clients request a user's transaction_history. An anchored asset that doesn't need any authentication protocol for transaction_history doesn't need to specify this field. If an anchored asset supports for example  [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) authentication for transaction_history, the value for authentication_protocols = [sep10].



## API Endpoints

* [`POST /deposit`](#deposit): required
* [`POST /withdraw`](#withdraw): required
* [`GET /transactions`](#transaction-history): optional
* [`GET /transaction`](#single-historical-transaction): optional

## Authentication

Asset anchors that need authentication should do the relevant changes to their stellar.toml as stipulated above.

Wallets, Clients and Anchors should follow the authentication protocol specifications of each supported authentication protocol. For example  [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) web authentication to enable authenticated deposits, withdrawals, or transaction history lookups. 

## Cross-Origin Headers

Valid CORS headers are necessary to allow web clients from other sites to use the endpoints. The following HTTP header must be set for all transfer server responses, including error responses.

```
Access-Control-Allow-Origin: *
```

## HTTPS Only

This protocol involves the transfer of value, and so HTTPS is required for all endpoints for security.  Wallets and anchors should refuse to interact with any insecure HTTP endpoints.

## Recommendations

SEP-26 lays out many options for how deposit and withdrawal can work. These are recommendations for getting a wallet or anchor implementation working with minimal effort while providing a great user experience.

**Note:** Both wallets and anchors should implement a sandbox mode for testing that uses the Stellar testnet.

### Basic Wallet Implementation

* Identify anchors you want to support manually, and test them with your wallet to be sure they work before whitelisting them. We encourage you to support as many anchors as possible.
* For each anchor, use information from its [`stellar.toml`](sep-0001.md) file to display useful information to the user about the asset they've picked.
* Provide a UI that allows users to pick an asset, anchor, and amount to use for deposit or withdraw. The UI should display the asset's fee structure (if possible) as well as information such as the address of the anchor and description of the asset from the `stellar.toml` file.
* **Use the `stellar.toml` file**
    * Determine which anchor endpoints will require authentication
    * Fetch the asset's deposit & withdawal fee structure: show this to the user early in the process so they're fully informed.
* **Authentication**
   * If needed, perform [authentication](#authentication) via SEP-10 or any other supported authentication mechanism before hitting those endpoints
* **Make a request to `/deposit` or `/withdraw`.**
* **For `/deposit`**
    * If the issuer's `/deposit` endpoint immediately returns success:
        * display the deposit info that came back from the endpoint to the user, including fee. You're done! The user will execute the deposit exernally using the instructions if they want to.
    * Handle the [special cases](#special-cases), they're relatively common.
* **For `/withdraw`**
    * If the issuer's `/withdraw` endpoint immediately returns success:
        * Provide an interface to the user that allows them to view the withdrawal details including the computed fee. The user can confirm and then the wallet will initiate the withdrawal by sending the Stellar payment to the address provided by the issuer.
    * Some wallets might exchange currencies only once they're ready to send the withdrawal payment, so exchange rate fluctuations might require withdrawal values to slightly vary from the originally provided `amount`. Anchors are instructed to accept a variation of ±10% between the informed `amount` and the actual value sent to the anchor's Stellar account. The withdrawn amount will be adjusted accordingly.
* **Transaction history**
    * It provides a better experience for users to show deposits or withdrawals they've completed in the past via the `/transactions` endpoint, but it's not strictly necessary.

### Basic Anchor Implementation

* Decide which endpoints, if any, need to be [authenticated](#authentication).
* Pick your approach to [fees].
* **Providing transaction status**
    * Provide the `/transaction` endpoint. The wallet may rely on it to complete non-interactive withdrawals.
    * Provide the `/transactions` endpoint. Users like to see transaction histories.

## Deposit

A deposit is when a user sends an external token (BTC via Bitcoin, USD via bank transfer, etc...) to an address held by an anchor. In turn, the anchor sends an equal amount of tokens on the Stellar network (minus fees) to the user's Stellar account.

The deposit endpoint allows a wallet to get deposit information from an anchor, so a user has all the information needed to initiate a deposit. It also lets the anchor specify additional information (if desired) that the user must submit non-interactively via a popup browser window or via [SEP-12](sep-0012.md) to be able to deposit.

If the given account does not exist, or if the account doesn't have a trust line for that specific asset, see the [Special Cases](#special-cases) section below.


### Request

```
POST TRANSFER_SERVER/deposit
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

```

Request Parameters:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`asset_code` | string | The code of the asset the user wants to deposit with the anchor. Ex BTC, ETH, USD, INR, etc. This may be different from the asset code that the anchor issues. Ex if a user deposits BTC and receives MyBTC tokens, `asset_code` must be BTC.
`asset_issuer` | string | The issuer of the asset the user wants to deposit with the anchor. 
`account` | `G...` string | The stellar account ID of the user that wants to deposit. This is where the asset token will be sent.
`memo_type` | string | (optional) Type of memo that anchor should attach to the Stellar payment transaction, one of `text`, `id` or `hash`.
`memo` | string | (optional) Value of memo to attach to transaction, for `hash` this should be base64-encoded.
`email_address` | string | (optional) Email address of depositor. If desired, an anchor can use this to send email updates to the user about the deposit.
`type` | string | (required) Deposit option. If the anchor supports one or multiple deposit methods (e.g. `SEPA` or `SWIFT`), the wallet should specify `type`.
`wallet_name` | string | (optional) In communications / pages about the deposit, anchor should display the wallet name to the user to explain where funds are going.
`wallet_url` | string | (optional) Anchor should link to this when notifying the user that the transaction has completed.
`lang` | string | (optional) Defaults to `en`. Language code specified using [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1). `error` fields in the response should be in this language.

Example:

```
POST https://api.example.com/deposit
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

asset_code=ETH&account=GACW7NONV43MZIFHCOKCQJAKSJSISSICFVUJ2C6EZIW5773OU3HD64VI
```

### Response

There are several types of responses, depending on whether the anchor needs more information about the user, how it should be sent to the anchor, and if there are any errors.

The first response, the success response, is explained below. The other possible responses are shared with the withdrawal endpoint, and are explained in the [Deposit and Withdraw shared responses](#deposit-and-withdraw-shared-responses) section below.

#### 1. Success: no additional information needed

Response code: `200 OK`

This is the correct response if the anchor is able to accept the deposit and needs no additional information about the user. It should also be used if the anchor requires information about the user, but the information has previously been submitted and accepted.

The response body should be a JSON object with the following fields:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`how` | string | Markdown formatted  instructions for how to deposit the asset. In the case of most cryptocurrencies it is just an address to which the deposit should be sent. Wallets should make sure markdown inputs are sanitized for security purposes.
`eta` | int | (optional) Estimate of how long the deposit will take to credit in seconds.
`min_amount` | float | (optional) Minimum amount of an asset that a user can deposit.
`max_amount` | float | (optional) Maximum amount of asset that a user can deposit.
`fee` | float | (optional) Calculated fee (if any). In units of the deposited asset.
`extra_info` | array | (optional) JSON array with additional information about the deposit process. Each element in the array is formatted as follows {key: KEY, value: VALUE}. Wallets are encouraged to present extra_info in a tabular manner and enable easy copy to clipboard of each line value.


Bitcoin response example:

```json
{
  "how" : "1Nh7uHdvY6fNwtQtM1G5EZAFPLC33B59rB",
  "fee" : 0.0002
}
```

Ripple response example:

```json
{
  "how" : "**Ripple address**: rNXEkKCxvfLcM1h4HJkaj2FtmYuAWrHGbf\n\n**tag:** 88",
  "eta": 60,
  "fee_percent" : 0.1,
  "extra_info": [
    {
      "key" : "Important",
      "value": "Do not forget the tag"
    },
    {
      "key" : "Ripple Address",
      "value": "rNXEkKCxvfLcM1h4HJkaj2FtmYuAWrHGbf"
    },
    {
      "key" : "Tag",
      "value": "88"
    }

  ]
    
}
```

Mexican peso (MXN) response example:

```json
{
  "how" : "![STP logo](https://stpbank.com/logo.png)\n\nMake a payment to Bank: STP\n\nAccount: 646180111803859359",
  "eta": 1800,
  "extra_info": [
    
    {
      "key" : "Bank",
      "value": "STP"
    },
    {
      "key" : "Swift Code",
      "value": "XYZ"
    },
    {
      "key" : "Account",
      "value": "646180111803859359"
    }
  ]
}
```

##### Special Cases
###### Stellar account does not exist

If the given Stellar `account` does not exist, on receipt of the deposit, the anchor should use `create_account` to create the account with at least enough XLM for the minimum reserve and a trust line (2.01 XLM is recommended). The anchor should take some of the asset that is sent in to pay for the XLM. The anchor should not list this minimal funding as a fee because the user still receives the value of the XLM in their account. The anchor should detect if the account has been created before returning deposit information, and adjust the `min_amount` in the response to be at least the amount needed to create the account.

Since the anchor doesn't have the user account's secret key, the user must create a trust line to the anchor's asset before the anchor can send the remaining asset tokens to the user's account. The anchor should listen for the user to establish this trust line. Once the trust line is there, the anchor should send the remaining asset tokens to the account in Stellar to complete the deposit.

If the anchor does not support creating new accounts for users and `account` doesn't exist yet, the anchor should return a `400 Bad Request` error. The response body should be a JSON object containing an `error` field that explains why the request failed.

###### Stellar account doesn't trust asset

The deposit flow can only be fulfilled if the Stellar `Account` has established a trust line for the given asset. To ensure this is accomplished, when initiating the deposit flow, `Wallet` should check if the `Account` has a trust line for the given asset. If it doesn't:

1. `Wallet` checks if `Account` has enough XLM to create a trust line. If it does, skip to step `4`.
2. If `Account` doesn't have enough XLM, `Wallet` starts listening for transactions to the given `Account`, waiting for it to have enough XLM for a trust line.
3. When asked for a deposit, `Anchor` detects if `Account` has enough XLM to create a trust line. If it doesn't, `Anchor` sends the needed amount of XLM to the `Account` for creating a trust line. `Anchor` then starts listening for trust line creations for that `Account`.
4. `Wallet` detects the arrival of XLM in the `Account`, and establishes a trust line.
5. `Anchor` detects the trust line creation in the `Account`. If the asset is `AUTH_REQUIRED`, `Anchor` approves the new trust line.
6. `Anchor` proceeds with the deposit flow.

## Withdraw

This operation allows a user to redeem an asset currently on the Stellar network for the real asset (BTC, USD, stock, etc...) via the anchor of the Stellar asset.

The withdraw endpoint allows a wallet to get withdrawal information from an anchor, so a user has all the information needed to initiate a withdrawal. It also lets the anchor specify additional information (if desired) that the user must submit interactively via a popup browser window or via [SEP-12](sep-0012.md) to be able to withdraw.

### Request

```
POST TRANSFER_SERVER/withdraw
Content-Type: multipart/form-data
```

Request parameters:

Name | Type | Description

`asset_issuer` | string | The issuer of the asset the user wants to deposit with the anchor. 
`amount` | number | The amount the user wishes to withdraw. Some anchors may use the amount to withdraw to determine fees.
`type` | string |  Type of withdrawal. Can be: `crypto`, `bank_account`, `cash`, `mobile`, `bill_payment` or other custom values.
`dest` | string | The account that the user wants to withdraw their funds to. This can be a crypto account, a bank account number, IBAN, mobile number, or email address.
`account` | `G...` string | The stellar account ID of the user that wants to do the withdrawal. This can be used by the anchor to calculate fees based on the account. It might also be needed if the anchor requires KYC information for withdrawal. The anchor can use `account` to look up the user's KYC information.
`memo` | string | (optional) A wallet will send this to uniquely identify a user if the wallet has multiple users sharing one Stellar account. The anchor can use this along with `account` to look up the user's KYC info.
`memo_type` | string | (optional) Type of `memo`. One of `text`, `id` or `hash`.
`wallet_name` | string | (optional) In communications / pages about the withdrawal, anchor should display the wallet name to the user to explain where funds are coming from.
`wallet_url` | string | (optional) Anchor can show this to the user when referencing the wallet involved in the withdrawal (ex. in the anchor's transaction history).
`lang` | string | (optional) Defaults to `en`. Language code specified using [ISO 639-1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_639-1). `error` fields in the response should be in this language.

Example:

```
POST https://api.example.com/withdraw
Content-Type: multipart/form-data

asset_code=ETH&dest=0xde0B295669a9FD93d5F28D9Ec85E40f4cb697BAe
```

### Response

There are several possible kinds of response, depending on whether the anchor needs more information about the user, how it should be sent to the anchor, and if there are any errors.

The first response, the success response, is explained below. The other possible responses are shared with the deposit endpoint, and are explained in the [Deposit and Withdraw shared responses](#deposit-and-withdraw-shared-responses) section directly below.

#### 1. Success: no additional information needed

Response code: `200 OK`

This is the correct response if the anchor is able to execute the withdrawal and needs no additional information about the user. It should also be used if the anchor requires information about the user, but the information has previously been submitted and accepted.

The response body should be a JSON object with the following fields:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`account_id` | `G...` string | The account the user should send its token back to.
`memo_type` | string | (optional) Type of memo to attach to transaction, one of `text`, `id` or `hash`.
`memo` | string | (optional) Value of memo to attach to transaction, for `hash` this should be base64-encoded.
`eta` | int | (optional) Estimate of how long the withdrawal will take to credit in seconds.
`min_amount` | float | (optional) Minimum amount of an asset that a user can withdraw.
`max_amount` | float | (optional) Maximum amount of asset that a user can withdraw.
`fee` | float | (optional) If there is a fee for withdraw. Already calculated. In units of the withdrawn asset.
`extra_info` | array | (optional) Any additional data needed as an input for this withdraw, example: Bank Name.

Example:

```json
{
  "account_id": "GCIBUCGPOHWMMMFPFTDWBSVHQRT4DIBJ7AD6BZJYDITBK2LCVBYW7HUQ",
  "memo_type": "id",
  "memo": "123"
}
```

## Deposit and Withdraw shared responses

### 2. Customer information needed (non-interactive)

Response code: `403 Forbidden`

If the anchor needs more information about the customer and all the information can be received non-interactively via [SEP-12](sep-0012.md), this is the correct response. Once the user / wallet transmits information via SEP-12, they can retry the deposit or withdraw endpoint to see if the anchor is ready to execute the deposit or withdrawal.

The response body should be a JSON object with the following fields:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`type` | string | Always set to `non_interactive_customer_info_needed`.
`fields` | list of strings | A list of field names that need to be transmitted via SEP-12 for the deposit to proceed.

The field names specified in `fields` must be drawn from the list defined in [SEP-9](sep-0009.md).

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "non_interactive_customer_info_needed",
  "fields" : ["family_name", "given_name", "address", "tax_id"],
}
```

**`jwt` details**

If the anchor's deposit or withdrawal endpoints require [SEP-10](sep-0010.md) authentication, the wallet should include this extra parameter. It allows the anchor to continue the non-interactive flow without requiring the user to authenticate again. When the user visits the anchor's interactive flow URL and provides a `jwt`, the anchor must verify the JWT.

* **If the JWT is valid**: The anchor must honor the user's authenticated session. The anchor should respond with a `302 redirect` response that sets a cookie authenticating the user and redirects the user to a different URL that does not contain the `jwt` parameter. This is to avoid the JWT appearing in the user's browser history. After the redirect, the authenticated interactive flow must continue as usual.
* **If the JWT is missing or invalid**: The anchor may display a login or signup form allowing the user to authenticate manually. On success, the anchor may allow the deposit / withdrawal to proceed normally.


### 4. Customer Information Status

Response code: `403 Forbidden`

An anchor should use this response if customer information was submitted for the `account`, but the information is either still being processed or was not accepted.

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`type` | string | Always set to `customer_info_status`.
`status` | string | Status of customer information processing. One of: `pending`, `denied`.
`more_info_url` | string | (optional) A URL the user can visit if they want more information about their account / status.
`eta` | int | (optional) Estimated number of seconds until the customer information status will update.

If the anchor decides that more customer information is needed after receiving some information and processing it, it can respond again with a response of type `interactive_customer_info_needed` or `non_interactive_customer_info_needed`. In the case of a `denied` request, an anchor can use the `more_info_url` to explain to the user the issue with their request and give them a way to rectify it manually. A wallet should show the `more_info_url` to the user when explaining that the request was denied.

Note: this status response should never be used in the case that the user's KYC request succeeds. In that case, the anchor should respond with a deposit / withdrawal address as described by those endpoints.

Example:

```json
{
  "type": "customer_info_status",
  "status": "denied",
  "more_info_url": "https://api.example.com/kycstatus?account=GACW7NONV43MZIFHCOKCQJAKSJSISSICFVUJ2C6EZIW5773OU3HD64VI"
}
```

### 5. Authentication required

Response code: `401 Authorization`

This endpoint requires [authentication](#authentication).

```json
{
  "type": "authentication_required"
}
```

### 6. Error

Every other HTTP status code will be considered an error. The body should contain a string indicating the error details.  This error is in a human readable format in the language indicated in the request and is intended to be displayed by the wallet.
For example:

```json
{
   "error": "This anchor doesn't support the given currency code: ETH"
}
```


## Transaction History

The transaction history endpoint helps anchors enable a better experience for users using an external wallet. With it, wallets can display the status of deposits and withdrawals while they process and a history of past transactions with the anchor. It's only for transactions that are deposits to or withdrawals from the anchor.

```
GET TRANSFER_SERVER/transactions
```

* `pending_anchor` -- deposit/withdrawal is being processed internally by anchor.
* `pending_stellar` -- deposit/withdrawal operation has been submitted to Stellar network, but is not yet confirmed.
* `pending_trust` -- the user must add a trust-line for the asset for the deposit to complete.
* `pending_user` -- the user must take additional action before the deposit / withdrawal can complete.
* `pending_user_transfer_start` -- the user has not yet initiated their transfer to the anchor. This is the necessary first step in any deposit or withdrawal flow.
* `incomplete` -- there is not yet enough information for this transaction to be initiated. Perhaps the user has not yet entered necessary info in an interactive flow.
* `no_market` -- could not complete deposit because no satisfactory asset/XLM market was available to create the account.
* `too_small` -- deposit/withdrawal size less than `min_amount`.
* `too_large` -- deposit/withdrawal size exceeded `max_amount`.
* `error` -- catch-all for any error not enumerated above.

Example response:

```json
{
  "transactions": [
    {
      "id": "82fhs729f63dh0v4",
      "kind": "deposit",
      "status": "pending_external",
      "status_eta": 3600,
      "external_transaction_id": "2dd16cb409513026fbe7defc0c6f826c2d2c65c3da993f747d09bf7dafd31093",
      "amount_in": "18.34",
      "amount_out": "18.24",
      "amount_fee": "0.1",
      "started_at": "2017-03-20T17:05:32Z"
    },
    {

      "kind": "withdrawal",
      "status": "completed",
      "amount_in": "500",
      "amount_out": "495",
      "amount_fee": "3",
      "started_at": "2017-03-20T17:00:02Z",
      "completed_at": "2017-03-20T17:09:58Z",

    }
  ]
}
```

Every HTTP status code other than `200 OK` will be considered an error. An empty transaction list is *not* an error. The body should contain error details.
For example:

```json
{
   "error": "This anchor doesn't support the given currency code: ETH"
}
```

## Single Historical Transaction

The transaction endpoint enables clients to query/validate a specific transaction at an anchor.

```
GET TRANSFER_SERVER/transaction
```

Request parameters:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`id` | string | (optional) The id of the transaction.
`stellar_transaction_id` | (optional) string | The stellar transaction id of the transaction.
`external_transaction_id` | (optional) string | The external transaction id of the transaction.

One of `id`, `stellar_transaction_id` or `external_transaction_id` is required.

On success the endpoint should return `200 OK` HTTP status code and a JSON object with the following fields:

Name | Type | Description
-----|------|------------
`transaction` | object | The transaction that was requested by the client.

The `transaction` object should be of the same form as the objects returned by the `TRANSFER_SERVER/transactions` endpoint.

Example response:

```json
{
  "transaction": {
      "id": "82fhs729f63dh0v4",
      "kind": "deposit",
      "status": "pending_external",
      "status_eta": 3600,
      "external_transaction_id": "2dd16cb409513026fbe7defc0c6f826c2d2c65c3da993f747d09bf7dafd31093",
      "amount_in": "18.34",
      "amount_out": "18.24",
      "amount_fee": "0.1",
      "started_at": "2017-03-20T17:05:32Z"
    }
}
```

If the transaction cannot be found, the endpoint should return a `404 NOT FOUND` result.

Every HTTP status code other than `200 OK` will be considered an error. An empty transaction list is *not* an error. The body should contain error details.
For example:

```json
{
   "error": "This anchor doesn't support the given currency code: ETH"
}
```
